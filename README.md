# menumetrics
repo for project menumetrics

The team: Michael Denis, Rozaliya Everstova, Natalie Lowell, and Joel Sands 

The idea: MenuMetrics provides you with menu options of nearby restaurants based on your target nutrition values. The app is a great solution for the people who eat out but would like to have bigger control of the nutrition.

The measurement of success: % of email signups / # people introduced to app
